Merge vs Rebase
---------------
Merge smashes multiple works into 1 context
Rebase plays out more linearly

Squash
- merge a bunch of little commits into one big commit

Oh Shit, Git

Reflogging is much cooler than ref-log

Workflows
- Master Branch FTW!
- GitHub Style / Feature Branching
- GitFlow
- Custom

GitHub Flow
- Never commit straight to Master
- only commits on Master are merges

Master always == Production

GitFlow
- branch for each level
  - dev, hotfix, Release, Master(Prod)

Custom
